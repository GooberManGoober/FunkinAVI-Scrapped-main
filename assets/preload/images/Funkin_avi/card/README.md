## IMPORTANT STUFF ABOUT CUSTOM CARD ARTS IN THIS FOLDER
- Your art MUST be in a dimension size of 600x350
- If you want only the card to be custom, just name it after the song name as if it were a chart file
- To customize your cards FULLY, you must create a json file like a chart under "data/cardData" also named directly under the song name, doing this allows you to name your card art whatever the fuck you want so, yeah, I'd prefer using this
